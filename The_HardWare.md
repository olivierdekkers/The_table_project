#HardWare

More technical asspect of the table itself will be linked here like technical
doccumentation or dimensions but also used lasers and electronic schemas for
lasers and fuses.


## Modularity

The goal of the project is to have every peace of hardware be as modular as
possible to have easy replacemanets incase of failure or just wear and tear.


##Basic Design

The very basic known concept is a table with a 55 - 60 inch tv screen in the
middle. Screen ouput is delivered by an Arduino. Some kind of depth meauring
sensors in the edges for multi touch.

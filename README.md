games are played on a tv screen. The touch screen is enabled through distance
measuring lasers in the sides of the table. For comfort cool design and clever
coverup the table will be poker style wher the edges of the table are raised and
comfortable to lay your arms on but also to fit the lasers for mearuring
underneath hidden.
